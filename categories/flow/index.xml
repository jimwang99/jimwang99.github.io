      <title>Case Study: Clock Skew Control</title>

      <description>Question: how to control the clock skew between a group of clocks to be minimum, say less than 30ps, instead of utilizing useful skew? This case happens to our hard macros.
A: in Innovus, use skew group
set min_skew_group { path/to/clock/NLVB_CKB path/to/clock/NLVA_CKB path/to/clock/NLVP_CKB } create_ccopt_skew_group \ -name min_skew_group \ -sources path/to/clock/source/CKB \ -sinks $min_skew_group \ -target_insertion_delay 0.500 \ -rank 1 -target_skew 0.000 set_ccopt_property constraints -skew_group min_skew_group ccopt </description>

      <description>As shown in the schematic, we have some clock divider that divide root clock by half. While in scan mode, these flip-flops will be bypassed and treated as normal flip-flop that need to be inserted into the scan chain along with leaf flip-flops. But due to the nature of clock tree, clock divider will be in the upper stream and will have a much smaller clock insertion delay. Then it will cause large hold time violation from clock generator flip-flops to normal leaf flip-flops, and these violations cannot be fixed easily.</description>

      <title>My experience with custom digital design</title>

      <description>Background This is the summary of my experience from project LBRAM in Marvell in the year of 2014.
The first thing: discuss timing/area/power SPEC&amp;rsquo;s in details Most of the time, because custom design takes lots of time, it often starts ahead of chips. At that time, the design SPEC&amp;rsquo;s, such as timing/area/power, are not clear. So try to discuss it with your supervisor or the project leader or your customer to define these SPEC&amp;rsquo;s even if they are not accurate.</description>
